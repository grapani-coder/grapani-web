        <h2>About Myself</h2>
             <p>Hi, I'm Jeniffer Grapani, I'm 18 yrs old and I want to share my some personal information about my self. I'm a 1st year college student at Occidental Mindoro School College(OMSC), and the course I'm taking is Bachelor of Science Information and Technology(BSIT). It's really difficult, if you don't have a knowledge when it comes to computer. we are only 3 siblings, and I'm the youngest. There's a 20 years gap between me and my sister, who I followed. I grew up in a christian family, and almost all of us is active in church gathering. I'm always just at home because I don't like to go out to relax, and I don't have many friends either./<p>
